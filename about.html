        <h2>About Curiosity</h2>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The Curiosity Project is a project created by Jiro Segoe on October 12th 2024.</p>
        <p>The main purpose of the project is to create a machine that can create life to bring the Inanimate Insanity contestants into the world.</p>
        <p>The Inanimate Insanity characters has been brought to life and came out of the Curiosity Recovery Center on November 9th 2024.</p>
        <p>On January 2nd 2025, Jiro had the idea of creating the Toons from Dandy's World with this machine. He also creates the Toons days after their release on their original game.</p>
        <p>Some day in March, he decides to also create Toons from an AU called "Candy's Bootleg World" which is a Dandy's World AU with bootleg Toons in a building near Gardenview. The reason of doing this is that these Toons are abused by the workers of that building.</p>
        <h3>The CRC</h3>
        <p>The Curiosity Recovery Center (CRC) is a machine similar to the Wireless Recovery Center in BFDI:TPOT. It has a keyboard on it, a recover button and a retry button.</p>
        <p>The CRC is connected to a computer who controls the database in order to be able to create, update or delete a character. The description of the character has to be accurate, including appearance, personality and what the characters like or dislike.</p>
        <p>When a character is created, it will come out of the machine, but with the downside of the character being naked after creation and recovery. We have to be sure to have clothes near the CRC to dress the character except if it's an object or an animal.</p>
        <p>Every time a character dies, a notification gets sent to the owner of the CRC to recover it there.</p>
        <p>Notice : if a character is corrupted by something harmful or turns Twisted, the character has to be executed and recovered back to the CRC.</p>
