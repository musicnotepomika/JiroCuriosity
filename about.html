        <h2>About Curiosity</h2>
        <p>The Curiosity Project is a project created by Jiro Segoe on October 12th 2024.</p><br>
        <p>The main purpose of the project is to create a machine that can create life to bring the Inanimate Insanity contestants into the world.</p><br>
        <p>The Inanimate Insanity characters has been brought to life and came out of the Curiosity Recovery Center on November 9th 2024.</p><br>
        <p>On January 2nd 2025, Jiro had the idea of creating the Toons from Dandy's World with this machine. He also creates the Toons days after their release on their original game.</p><br>
        <p>Some day in March, he decides to also create Toons from an AU called "Candy's Bootleg World" which is a Dandy's World AU with bootleg Toons in a building near Gardenview. The reason of doing this is that these Toons are abused by the workers of that building.</p>
